Everything you need to know about ChainRules 1.0

I changed order of packages to align it more with presentation. You can find my proposition of timestamps [here](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/YouTubeVideoTimestamps/issues/119).




JuliaCon 2021 | Day 3 Single Track | Soumith Chintala Keynote

_JuliaCon 2021 | Day 3 Single Track | Soumith Chintala Keynote_, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6jk_OdH-w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6jk_OdH-w)

It is very nontechnical talk, while I prefer technical ones, so making timestamps was especially hard to me. Correct every one of my mistakes that you find and change anything you want.

I think we should replace line in the description
"Keynote ( Soumith Chintala): PyTorch and my journey in open source"
with
"Keynote by Soumith Chintala: PyTorch and my journey in open source".

Here you can find my propositions for [timestamps](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/YouTubeVideoTimestamps/issues/125).

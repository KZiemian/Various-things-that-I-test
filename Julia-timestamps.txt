What's Bad About Julia - Jeff Bezanson [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuJsgyu87U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuJsgyu87U)

Today I will complaining about timestamps that I made [myself](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/YouTubeVideoTimestamps/issues/107). It is quite fitting, after all if I criticize what others did, I should also criticize what I did wrong.

Now we have in timestamps
> 21:34 Problem of "X is more specific that Y. Example 1
> 23:32 Problem of "X is more specific that Y. Example 2

I probably should write something like text below.
> 21:34 Problem with "X is more specific that Y". Example 1
> 23:32 Problem with "X is more specific that Y". Example 2

But someone more skilled with English should judge which form is better. In any case, closing quotation mark need to added.

Code illustrating "/tikz/ever pic" is not related to pic mechanics.

Version: 3.1.4b.

Section "18.2 The Pic Syntax", pages 262.

Code that should illustrate usage of "/tikz/every pic" is
```
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw}]
\draw (0,0) node {A} -- (1,1) node {B};
\end{tikzpicture}
```
have no relation to pic and is probably copy from chapter on the nodes.
